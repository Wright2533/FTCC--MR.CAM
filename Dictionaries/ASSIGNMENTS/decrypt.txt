No one is un7w7re of the n7me of th7t f7mous 0nglish shipowner, 4un7r1.
In 1840 this shrew1 in1ustri7list foun1e1 7 post7l servi3e 5etween Liverpool 7n1 H7lif7x, fe7turing three woo1en ships with 400-horsepower p711le wheels 7n1 7 5ur1en of 1,162 metri3 tons.
0ight ye7rs l7ter, the 3omp7ny's 7ssets were in3re7se1 5y four 650-horsepower ships 7t 1,820 metri3 tons, 7n1 in two more ye7rs, 5y two other vessels of still gre7ter power 7n1 tonn7ge.
In 1853 the 4un7r1 4o., whose m7il-37rrying 3h7rter h71 just 5een renewe1, su33essively 711e1 to its 7ssets the 8r75i7, the Persi7, the 4hin7, the S3oti7, the J7v7, 7n1 the Russi7, 7ll ships of top spee1 7n1, 7fter the Gre7t 07stern, the 5iggest ever to plow the se7s.
So in 1867 this 3omp7ny owne1 twelve ships, eight with p711le wheels 7n1 four with propellers.
If I give these highly 3on1ense1 1et7ils, it is so everyone 37n fully un1erst7n1 the import7n3e of this m7ritime tr7nsport7tion 3omp7ny, known the worl1 over for its shrew1 m7n7gement.
No tr7nso3e7ni3 n7vig7tion7l un1ert7king h7s 5een 3on1u3te1 with more 75ility, no 5usiness 1e7lings h7ve 5een 3rowne1 with gre7ter su33ess.
In twenty-six ye7rs 4un7r1 ships h7ve m71e 2,000 8tl7nti3 3rossings without so mu3h 7s 7 voy7ge 37n3ele1, 7 1el7y re3or1e1, 7 m7n, 7 3r7ft, or even 7 letter lost.
833or1ingly, 1espite strong 3ompetition from Fr7n3e, p7ssengers still 3hoose the 4un7r1 line in preferen3e to 7ll others, 7s 37n 5e seen in 7 re3ent survey of offi3i7l 1o3uments.
Given this, no one will 5e 7stonishe1 7t the upro7r provoke1 5y this 733i1ent involving one of its finest ste7mers.
